# Arch Install Scripts
A set of basic scripts to automate my Arch installations by automatically applying most of my settings and installing the base and essential packages for a functioning system.

## Things to add
This currently a work-in-progress. Things I'm planning to add are:
- [ ] An Arch + DWM installer

### Important notes
- This does not include a desktop environment or window manager.
